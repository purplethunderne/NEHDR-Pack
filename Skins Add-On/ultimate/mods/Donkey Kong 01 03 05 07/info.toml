Bodacious.

Replaces every other DK alternate costume with a totally tubular appearance by Funky Kong!
Comes with an edited model with custom expressions, custom renders, stock icons, and voicelines from MKWii too!
Also comes with an effects file that changes the hand slap to blue, so you can make your opponents ride the waves!
(Note : The effects file changes the hand slap effect for every alt, not just the Funky Kong ones.)
