Roy (ロイ, Roy) is a unlockable character in Super Smash Bros. Melee. He is a clone of Marth, differentiated primarily by his sweetspots being located near the center of his blade rather than the tip. He is voiced by Jun Fukuyama.

Roy currently ranks 21st on the Melee tier list, in the D tier. Roy's advantages include an above average approach due to having one of the best SHFFLs in the game, as well as a good grab game, and among the best reaches in the game thanks to his sword. However, Roy's flaws are significant, which include having poor flexibility in his combo game, attacks that are difficult to properly land, generally possessing significantly laggy attacks, having few moves that can KO reliably and only one of which (forward smash) that is an adequate finisher, and one of the worst recoveries in the game while being a light character that is heavily susceptible to combos; as a result, Roy has significant KOing problems while being easy to KO himself. These flaws overpower Roy's strengths, leading to numerous matchups hard countering him, especially against those who are higher ranked than him on the tier list.
