The Zelda in Skyward Sword is the eleventh Zelda appearing in The Legend of Zelda series, and is currently the earliest incarnation of Zelda chronologically to appear in-game.

In Skyward Sword, Zelda, daughter of Gaepora, lives in Skyloft with her childhood friend Link,  where they are both students at the Knight Academy.  After playing the role of the goddess at the Wing Ceremony, Link and Zelda go for a flight together, when suddenly a twister pulls Zelda and her Loftwing below the clouds. This phenomenon is later revealed to have been caused by Ghirahim, who needs Zelda's soul to resurrect Demise, his master. Upon Zelda's arrival on the Surface, however, she is rescued by Impa before the Demon Lord can capture her.  Link then begins to look for Zelda and eventually finds her in the Earth Spring, but Impa impedes him from reaching the young girl,and instead urges Zelda to continue praying at each goddess statue to finish purifying her body.
